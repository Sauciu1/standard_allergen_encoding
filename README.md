# AllergyAlly - Standard Allergen Encoding

A system for encoding allergen information into memorable word codes that can be easily shared and decoded.

## Quick Start (No Setup Required!)

The app works out of the box using a pre-built database dump file. Just run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or with uv (recommended)
uv sync
.venv\Scripts\activate
flask --app flaskr run --debug
```
